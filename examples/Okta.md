# Okta Example

In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

## Why Okta

It is very hard to quickly and securely add authentication to your application. Okta is an industry wide used identity platform. Software companies and engineer's often turn to third-party services like Okta instead of writing their own signin process.

## Getting Started

You must [signup for Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and signup for the free "Workforce Identity Cloud". Please create a new username and password instead of signing up with Github or Google. If you signup with Github or Google, you will need to reset your password later on, and there may be permission errors when you try to do this.

[Follow this tutorial from Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-in-to-spa-embedded-widget/react/main/#create-an-okta-app-integration) to create
a Single Page React Application with the Okta Sign-In Widget.
