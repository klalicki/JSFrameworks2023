# Final Project Example (Auth, Routing, and the Context API)

In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

## Getting Started

Before starting this application, you will need to install the companion authorization and API server. Please follow the _Getting Started_ steps [in this README.md](../../authorization-server/README.md).

Once that is installed, you can get started by running:

```bash
cd examples/final-project/
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

If, at any time, you need to stop the app, press `ctrl+c`.
